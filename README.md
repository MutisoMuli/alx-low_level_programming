C Programming Repository

This repository contains a collection of C programs, each organized into specific directories. These programs cover various topics and demonstrate different aspects of C programming. Here's an overview of what you'll find in this repository:

0x00-hello_world
This directory contains a C program that prints the message: "and that piece of art is useful" - Dora Korpar. It's a simple introduction to C programming.

0x01-variables_if_else_while
In this directory, you'll find C programs that cover the use of variables, conditional statements (if-else), and loops (while). These programs are fundamental for understanding control flow in C.

0x02-functions_nested_loops
The scripts in this directory focus on functions and nested loops in C. One of the notable programs is 104-fibonacci.c, which generates Fibonacci numbers.

0x03-debugging
Debugging is a critical skill in software development. This directory contains C programs that need debugging. It also includes a header file (main.h) to support debugging efforts.

0x04-more_functions_nested_loops
Building on the concepts from 0x02, this directory contains programs that involve more complex functions and nested loops. Notably, it includes 101-print_number.c, which demonstrates printing numbers in C.

0x05-pointers_arrays_strings
Pointers, arrays, and strings are essential in C programming. This directory contains programs that work with these concepts, including 101-keygen.c.

0x06-pointers_arrays_strings
This directory is dedicated to cleaning up unnecessary files. It's good practice to keep your project tidy.

0x07-pointers_arrays_strings
In this directory, you'll find the program 101-crackme_password, which likely involves password cracking or security-related tasks.

0x08-recursion
Recursion is a powerful programming concept. This directory includes 101-wildcmp.c, a program that likely explores recursive pattern matching.

0x09-static_libraries
Here, you'll find a script, create_static_lib.sh, which is used to create static libraries in C.

0x0A-argc_argv
The program 100-change.c in this directory is designed to work with command-line arguments (argc and argv) and may perform some kind of change calculation.

0x0B-malloc_free
Memory allocation and deallocation are crucial in C programming. This directory contains 101-strtow.c, which likely involves string manipulation and memory management.

0x0C-more_malloc_free
Building on memory management, this directory includes 101-mul.c, which may involve multiplication of large numbers.

0x0D-preprocessor
Preprocessor directives are explored in this directory, and it includes the header file 4-sum.h.

0x0E-structures_typedef
Data structures and typedefs are crucial for organizing data in C. This directory includes the header file dog.h, which may define a "dog" structure.

0x0F-function_pointers
Function pointers are a powerful feature in C. The directory includes 100-main_opcodes.c, which likely works with opcode execution.

0x10-variadic_functions
Variadic functions allow for variable numbers of arguments. The directory contains 3-print_all.c, which may involve printing different types of data.

0x12-singly_linked_lists
Linked lists are explored in this directory. It includes 101-hello_holberton.asm, possibly an assembly code file.

0x13-more_singly_linked_lists
Building on linked lists, this directory contains 103-find_loop.c, likely used to find loops in linked lists.

0x14-bit_manipulation
Bit manipulation is a low-level operation in C. This directory includes the program 101-password, which may involve working with bit-level operations.

0x15-file_io
File input and output are essential. The directory includes 100-elf_header.c, which may involve parsing ELF headers.

Please explore the individual directories to learn more about each program and its specific purpose. Happy coding!
